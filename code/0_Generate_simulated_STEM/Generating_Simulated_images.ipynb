    "# Generating Simulated Images\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll generate simulated images from incostem (computem written by Earl Kirkland)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### generate_simulated_image.py\n",
    "The main script including loading necessary parameters and functions, call incostem for image simulation, post-processing, and removing temporary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### params.py\n",
    "The py file contains necessary simulation parameters (crystal structures, defect densities, microscope parameters). These parameters should be carefully set to reflect the actual variation in your experimental data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### post_process.py\n",
    "The py file contains post-processing functions and experimentalize parameters to make simulated images more realistic comparing to experimental images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note for incostem (computem)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run incostem successfully, check the following:\n",
    "1. Download the executable or compile it from the source code. Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/computem/files/ \n",
    "2. The flag \"if_incostem_cmd\" in \"param.py\" must reflect your working environment. \"True\" for cmd users, \"False\" for Linux users.\n",
    "3. The path of computem must be added to the environmental variable of \"Path\""
