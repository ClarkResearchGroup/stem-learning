    "This script performs the training of a network after the dataset has been constructed. Four modules are used in this training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `input_data.py`: This module loads in the training and testing data that was created, and prepares it so that it can be fed into the neural network for training.\n",
    "2. `models.py`: this module contains different types of neural network architectures. One can choose a model from this script and train it.\n",
    "3. `training_utilities.py`: this module contains functions to construct models, set up diagnostic files, and perform the training on the model.\n",
    "4. `accuracy.py`: The accuracy that the FCN outputs looks at the predicted label and evaluated label, and does a pixelwise comparison (#pixels set to the correct value)/(#pixels in the image). This isn't the best way to determine the success of our model. Rather, we want to look at a metric that shows that the model is detecting defects (where each defect consists of multiple pixels). Hence we use measures such as the recall, which is the number of true positive defect detections TN over the true positives plus the false negatives (FN), R = TN/(TN+FN). This module helps in calculating such metrics\n",
